There are many liquidity pools on LFJ.gg that are not as optimised as they can be.
This project aims to help the liquidity providers by building tools to help assess
the best decision to take to improve their yield while simultaneously helping the
network by providing liquidity and stabilising the prices in the market.


Questions:
1. What are the key metrics when deciding on the liquidity structure?
2. Is the liquidity pool and price graph sufficient information?

Phase:
1. Build necessary tools, answer the questions.
